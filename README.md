Many hear but fail to listen. Such people never understand what they are meant to respond to. It is a major crises.

There are people who read, but fail to understand what they read. The reason for this cancerous menace is multifaceted. Some do not know that the real purpose for reading is to be informed. They simply skim through and stay unbothered. There are those who read with their reasoning faculties completely detached from them, and as such they do not understand. Some are very self centered and proud. They simply cling to what they think they know, thereby making no room for learning anything new. Such people tend to listen or read only to make an immediate response that's based on what they already think they know.

Why this competion? It was established to encourage people within a wide age bracket to read intentionally and also gain something valueble from what they read. It also brings with it the spirit of competition that has been long lost from the circle of the so-called intellectuals.

The benefits of reading and the enlightenment that comes with it cannot be over emphasized. Pristine Productions is commited to restore the dignity of knowledge, learning, research, and competitiveness to the younger generation of the Nigerian clime.
